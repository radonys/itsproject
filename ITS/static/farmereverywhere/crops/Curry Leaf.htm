<h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
<p>It does not require a
    specific climate and can come up in dry climate too. In places where minimum temperature
    goes below 13<sup>0</sup>C, the growth of shoot will be slightly affected. Though it can
    be cultivated in most of the soil types, it comes up well in light textured red soils. </p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Farmer prefers local
    varieties, which have pink midrib. University of Agricultural Science, Dharwad has
    recently released two cultivars viz DWD  1 and DWD 2 which have an oil content
    of 5.22 and 4.09% respectively. Both the varieties are having strong aroma.</p>
<h2>Preparation of field and planting</h2>
<p>Mainfield should be
    ploughed repeatedly. Normally, a spacing of 90 to 120cm is followed on either side. One
    month before planting, pits of 30 x 30 x 30cm dimensions are dug out and are filled with
    top soil mixed with well decomposed farm yard manure at the time of planting. Healthy
    seedlings are planted in the centre of the pits. Then long furrows are formed connecting
    all the pits to facilitate easy irrigation.<br/><br/>The seedlings are
    irrigated once in five to seven days upto three years and once in 15 days afterwards. The
    field should be kept free of weeds. Normally curry leaf plants are not fertilized with
    inorganic source by the farmers. However, for a better growth and yield, each plant may be
    fertilized with 20kg of Farmyard manure besides 150g nitrogen, 25g phosphorus, and 50g of
    potash per year.</p>
<h2>Harvesting and yield</h2>
<p>At the end of first year, the crop comes to first harvest. The expected yield from one hectare is given below:</p>
<p>The plantation can be kept for 20 to 25 years depending upon the management practices
    followed.</p>
