<h2>Climate and soil</h2>
<p>Tea is exacting in its
    climatic requirements. The temperature may vary from 16 to 320C and annual rainfall should
    be 125 to 150 cm, which is well distributed over 8-9 months in a year. The atmospheric
    humidity should be always around 80% during most of the time. Very dry atmosphere is not
    congenial for tea. It is grown in plains in North Eastern States but in South India, it is
    grown in hill ranges from 600 to 2200 m above M.S.L.<br/><br/>Tea is a calcifuge
    crop requiring comparatively low amounts of calcium but high quantities of potassium and
    silicon. They can be grown in lateritic, alluvial and peaty soils. Optimum pH range is 4.5
    to 5.0 and soil depth should be 1.0 to 1.5m.</p>
<h2>Propagation</h2>
<p>Tea can be propagated
    by seed and by cuttings. Seeds collected from the fruits of seed baries are soaked in
    water and only heavy seeds, which sink, are alone used for sowing in beds. Germination
    occurs in 20 to 30 days. At that stage they are carefully lifted and transplanted in
    polythene sleeves. They will be ready for planting in 9 months.</p>
<h2>Vegetative propagation</h2>
<p>The site for the nursery can be selected in a flat land or gentle slope, near
    to a perennial water source and easily accessible by road. It should have a good drainage
    and should be protected from wind, frost and wild animals etc. approximately, 0.15 ha
    nursery area is required to produce 1.25 lakhs cuttings. Nursery area is to be provided
    with overhead shade by erecting concrete or stone pillars at a spacing of 3x3m and spread
    with 6mm<sup>2</sup> mesh double strand coirmat which provides about 67% shade.<br/><br/>The cuttings for
    rooting are collected from mother bushes, which are well maintained near the nursery area.
    Such mother bushes are pruned well in advance to induce juvenile shoots. These juvenile
    shoots are collected in the morning hours and 3cm long cutting each with a healthy mother
    leaf and an active axillary bud is prepared. Cuttings from top tender and bottom brown
    wood should be avoided. These cuttings are planted in polythene bags (30cmx10cmx150
    gauge), filled with growing medium (Jungle soil: river sand 3:1) in the bottom and rooting
    medium (Red/subsoil:sand 1:1) in the top 8-10cm. The soil used for rooting media should
    have an optimum pH range of 4.8 to 5.0, if high, i.e., 5.1 to 5.5, or 5.6 to 6.0, it must
    be drenched with 1 or 2% aluminum sulphate solution respectively @ 1 litre per cubic foot
    of soil. This treatment should follow with drenching of twice the volume of plain water to
    wash excess aluminum sulphate. The cuttings are carefully planted at the centre of the
    bags in such a way that the petiole should not touch the soil and then they are watered.
    These bags are then covered with polythene sheets over the G.I. wire arhes and the sides
    are tugged well to preserve moisture content. Callusing starts in 4-6 weeks and rooting
    occurs in 10 to 12 weeks. When 80% of the cuttings have rooted, the tents are opened in
    stages and the overhead shade is gradually reduced to harden the plants.</p>
<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>The land is cleared of
    the roots of the fallen trees and drains are taken at suitable intervals depending upon
    the slope to conserve the soil. In the olden days, up and down system of planting at
    1.2x1.2m are followed. Presently, contour planting either in a single hedge or double
    hedge system is followed. </p>
<p>The
    last method has many advantages over the first two viz., early and high yield, better soil
    conservation, less weed growth in the hedge and efficient cultural practices. Planting
    season normally coincides with June/July and September/October for SouthWest monsoon and
    North East monsoon areas. Pits of 30x30x45cm size are dug and plants of 12-15 months old
    are planted by removing the polythene sleeves. Immediate after planting, plants are staked
    to prevent wind damage.</p>

<p>Immediately after
    planting, the soil surface around the plants should be mulched, usually cutgrasses of
    gautemala are employed for this purpose. About 25 tonnes of grass is required to mulch one
    hectare. Care must be taken to keep the mulch materials away from the collar region last
    they may cause collar diseases. If there is a dry weather, mud tubes or etah tubes may be
    buried 15cm deep near the plant in a slanting position and one litre of water per plant
    may be poured or injected at weekly intervals. This subsoil irrigation helps to minimise
    the causality besides encourages developing deeper roots.<br/><br/><b>Shade management</b><br/>Tea requires filtered
    shade and if it is exposed to direct sun, its growth is affected. Shade is hence essential
    and beneficial to tea as</p>
<ul>
<li>It regulates the temperature.</li>
<li>It minimises the effects of drought and
        radiation injury.</li>
<li>It increases the soil fertility </li>
<li>It helps in recycling of nutrients.</li>
<li>It helps in getting even distribution
        of crop.</li>
<li>It serves as windbreak.</li>
<li>It reduces the incidences of pests.</li>
<li>It generates additional income by way
        of timber and fuel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It must be an evergreen tree, easy to
        propagate having quick growing and deep rooted characters.</li>
<li>It provides filtered shade and
        withstands frequent lopping. </li>
<li>It tolerates wind and frost.</li>
<li>It does not have allopathic effect.</li>
<li>It has commercial timber value also.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Weed control</h2>
<p>Weeds will be a
    problem in young and pruned fields. Manual weeding is never recommended in tea lest more
    soil erosion and damage to surface roots and collar regions. Therefore, the following
    chemical weed control is alone recommended in tea.</p>

<h2>Training and Pruning</h2>
<p>In the young tea, when
    it has established well, centering i.e. removing the growing point leaving 8 to 10 mature
    leaves from the bottom, is done to induce secondaries. When the secondaries reach more
    than 60 cm, they are tipped at 50-55 cm height by removing 3 to 4 leaves and bud to induce
    tertiaries. Therefore, plucking at mother leaf stage is continued for better frame
    development. It takes nearly 18 to 20 months from planting to reach regular plucking field
    stage.<br/><br/><b>Pruning is done in tea</b></p>
<p>Pruning is normally
    done 4 to 6 years interval depending upon the altitude of the garden, nature of the
    materials etc. the bushes marked for pruning should have adequate starch reserves in roots
    otherwise the sprouting following pruning should have adequate starch reserves in roots
    otherwise the sprouting following pruning will be less. This can be normally tested by the
    common Iodine test and if the starch reserve is less, bushes are allowed to rest for 2 to
    3 months. The different types of pruning are as follows: -</p>
<p>Immediately after the
    rejuvenation or hard pruning, the cut ends are smeared with a paste made of copper
    oxychloride and linseed oil (1:1). The prunings, consisting of only small twings and
    leaves are buried in trenches of 30cm width and 45cm depth taken across the slope in
    alternate rows. The pruned bushes are given washing with 10% lime solution using No. IV
    nozzle of power sprayers in order to kill the epiphytic growth of moss and lichen so as to
    induce early and even bud break. Lime washing also minimises sunscorch to the bush frame.<br/><br/>The buds from the
    pruned shoots grow in a steady succession without any cessation of growth. These are known
    as a periodic shoots or primary shoots. These primary shoots should be induced to produce
    flush shoots, otherwise known as periodic shoots by regular tipping operation. Tipping is
    the removal of terminal portion of the shoot and it varies with jats and pruning height as
    given below. Tipping height refers to the number of leaves that must be left above the
    pruned cut while tipping in material refers to that portion of the terminal shoot, which
    must be tipped off.</p>
<ul>
<li>to maintain to convenient height for
        plucking </li>
<li>to induce more vegetative growth</li>
<li>to remove dead and de funct wood and </li>
<li>to remove the knots and interlaced
        branches. </li>

<h2>Manures and fertilisers</h2>
<p>Tea responds to
    manuring and it has been estimated that to produce 100kg of made tea, tea plant utilises
    on an average 10.2, 3.2 and 5.4kg of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potash per ha. Manuring in
    tea starts from nursery stage itself. Once they strike roots (after 4 months) 30g of
    soluble mixtures (Ammonium phosphate (20:20) 35 parts, potassium sulphate and Magnesium
    sulphate each 15 parts and zinc sulphate and Magnesium sulphate each 15 parts and zinc
    sulphate  3 parts) is dissolved in 10 litres of water and is applied with rosecan
    for about 900 plants. This must be repeated at 15 days intervals. <br/><br/><b>Nitrogen: </b>The
    recommendation for mature tea is based mostly on soil organic matter status and
    anticipated yield. For a field with medium organic matter status the following rates of
    application is suggested for every 100kg of made tea anticipated:</p>
<p>Twenty per cent of the
    total nitrogen is given in the form of Ammonium sulphate during March/April. Urea is
    recommended in May/June and receding monsoon months avoiding very wet and very dry periods
    and it will come to 65% of total nitrogen. Fifteen percent of the total nitrogen is
    applied in the form of Calcium Ammonium Nitrate during pre-winter (November-December). <br/><br/>
<b>Potassiu</b>m: Nitrogen
    and potassium are always applied together. NK ratio of 1:1 is used for plucking fields
    while for a pruned field 2:3 NK ratio is recommended. For rejuvenation pruned field 1:2 NK
    ratio is suggested. The enhanced rates of potassium application in the pruned year is to
    encourage formation of healthy farmers. Muriate of potash is the sources of potassium used
    in tea fields. The NK fertilizers are applied by broadcast for mature tea and is broadcast
    and dibbled in along the drip circle for young tea. The interval between two successive
    applications should be atleast 3-4 weeks.<br/><br/>
<b>Phosphorus:</b> Phosphorus
    is applied once in alternate years @ 90kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/ha for fields
    yielding less than 3000kg/ha for fields yielding between 3000 and 4500kg/ha, 60 to 80kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>/ha
    is suggested every year. The soils being acidic, rock phosphate could be advantageously
    used. The fertilizer should be placed at 15-22cm depth.<br/><br/>
<b>Micronutrients: </b>Among
    the micronutrients, zinc deficiency is often manifested in young shoots characterised by
    reduced leaf size, rosetting, chlorosis and formation of more banji shoots. Application of
    zinc sulphate @ 6 to 8kg/ha for high yielding fields every year is the general
    recommendation. The above quantity can be given in 4 to 5 split applications during has
    been found beneficial to combine other micronutirents viz., Manganese sulphate @ 15.5g/10
    litres and boric acid @ 5.5g/10 litres of spray volume along with zinc sulphate spray.<br/><br/>
<b>Liming:</b> In the hill
    soils, due to the leaching of bases by rain and also due to the incessant application of
    acid forming fertilizers, the soil pH is often reduced which affects the physical and
    chemical properties of soil. Therefore, periodical application of lime is essential
    properties of soil. Therefore, periodical application of lime is essential to amend the
    soil and maintain optimum pH. Agricultural lime (Calcium carbonate) and dolomitic lime
    (Calcium Magnesium carbonate) are generally recommended for tea soils. The rate of
    application is based on soil pH, rainfall, fertilizer usage and length of the pruning
    cycle. Roughly lime @ 1.5mt/ha for a pH between 4.5 to 4.9, 3.0mt/ha for a pH between 4.0
    to 4.4 and 4.0mt/ha for a pH of less than 4.0 is suggested. <br/>The lime is applied by
    evenly broadcasting prior to pruning once in a pruning cycle. First manuring following
    liming can be had after 6 weeks and a minimum of 15cm rainfall should have been received
    during this period.</p>

<h2>Harvesting or Plucking</h2>
<p>Plucking consists of harvesting 2 to 3 leaves and a bud. It is the most labour intensive operation in a tea
    industry and also decides the yield and quality of made tea. Normally, a pluckable shoot
    takes 60 to 90 days for harvesting since its sprouting from the axillary buds. When the
    shoot is plucked upto mother leaf, it is known as light plucking and if it is plucked
    below mother leaf, it is called hard plucking. The plucking interval and plucking standard
    in relation to cropping is given below:</p>

<h2>Yield</h2>
<p>Yield of made tea per
    hectare depends upon many factors such as elevation, clonal or seedling jats, management
    practices, severity of pruning, processing techniques etc., Generally, in tea industry, a
    field which yields upto 2000kg of made tea/ha is considered as low yielding and 2000 to
    3000kg as medium yielding and anything above 3000kg as high yielding fields. </p>
<h2>Manufacturing of Tea</h2>
<p>Basically, there are two types of processing viz.,</p>
<p><b>Irrespective of the method, manufacturing of tea involves the following steps:</b><br/><br/><b>Withering:</b> The
    objective of withering is to reduce the moisture content of leaves by spreading them in
    troughs which receive artificial air from fan fitted on one end. At the end of withering,
    the leaves attain a flaccid condition for which it may take 12 to 18 hours depending upon
    the weather condition.<br/><br/><b>Rolling:</b> This
    operation is carried on by a series of machines or in a single roller, during which the
    cells in the leaves are broken to liberate the sap containing the polyphenol oxidase, an
    enzyme, which in the presence of oxygen, oxidises the polyphenols to produce theaflavins
    and thearubigens. These are responsible for colouring of the tea and is a 30-40 minutes.
    Afterwards, the fine sifted rolled ones are sent for fermentation while the coarse ones
    are again sent for rolling.<br/><br/><b>Fermentation: </b>Rolled
    tea materials are either spread in concrete floors or kept in aluminum trays. In the
    presence of high humidity and proper step decides the quality i.e. strength, colour and
    briskness of tea. Fermentation requires 1 hour or 2 hours depending upon the environmental
    conditions.<br/><br/><b>Drying:</b> This step aims
    at stopping the fermentation process and slowly removing the moisture content without a
    burnt smell but preserving the inherent quality. This is achieved by passing the fermented
    tea in thin layers through conveyors into a drier in which the inlet temperature is
    maintained around 250  280<sup>0</sup>F and outlet temperature is a round 150-200<sup>0</sup>F.
    Proper drying takes 30-40 minutes.<br/><br/><b>Grading:</b> Before
    grading, the dried tea is removed of the stalky fibres, which affect the quality, by
    passing through fibre separate machines. The bulk tea is passed through different sized
    meshes which aid in separation into different grades.</p>
