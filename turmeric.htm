<h2><a name="1"></a><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Turmeric is the dried rhizome of <i>Curcuma longa, </i>a herbaceous plant. The rhizome has 1.8-5.4% <i>curcumin,
    </i>the pigment and 2.5-7.2% of essential oil. It is used as an important condiment and as
    a dye with varied applications in drug and cosmetic industries. In India, Andhra Pradesh
    is the leading state followed by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Kerala and Bihar.</p>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<p><span><a name="2"></a><b>Climate</b></span><br/>Turmeric
    can be grown from sea level to 1500m in the hills, at a temperature range of 20-30<sup>0</sup>C
    with a rainfall of 1500-2250mm per annum. It is also grown as an irrigated crop.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="3"></a><b>Soil</b></span><br/>It
    thrives best in a well drained sandy or clayey loam rich in humus content. It can be grown
    on different soil viz. light black, ashy loam and red soils to clay loams. 
</p>
<h2><a name="4"></a>Varieties</h2>
<p>CO1, BSR.1, Suguna, Suvarna, Sudharshana, Krishna, Sugundham, Roma, Suroma, Rajendra Sonia, Ranga, Rasmi. </p>
<h2><a name="5"></a> material and planting</h2>
<p>The areas where the rainfall is sufficiently early, crop can be planted during April-May with
    the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Since turmeric is a shade loving plant, castor or <i>Sesbania
    grandiflora </i>may be raised along the border lines in the field. Well developed healthy
    and disease free whole or split mother rhizomes weighing 35-44g are used for planting.
    Rhizomes are treated with 0.3% Dithane M-45 and 0.5% Malathion for 30 minutes before
    storing. Small pits are made with a hand hoe in the beds in rows with a spacing of 25x 30
    cm and covered with soil or dry powdered cattle manure. The optimum spacing in furrows and
    ridges is about 45-60 cm between the rows and 25 cm between the plants. A seed rate of
    2500kg of rhizomes are required for one hectare.</p>
<h2><a name="6"></a>Fertilizers</h2>
<p>Farm yard manure @10
    t/ha is applied as basal dressing. Beds are earthed up each time after top dressing. The
    NPK recommendation is 125:37:37kg per ha. Whole Phosphorus (P) and Potash (K<sub>2</sub>O)
    is given as basal dose at the time planting while Nitrogen (N) is applied as 25kg each at
    basal, 30,60,90 and 120 days after planting i.e., 125kg N.</p>
<h2>Intercultural Operations</h2>
<p><a name="7"></a>Mulching and weeding<br/>The
    crop is to be mulched immediately after planting with green leaves or banana psuedostem or
    sugarcane trash at the rate of 12-15 tonnes per hectare. It may be repeated for second
    time after 50 days with the same quantity of green leaves after weeding and application of
    fertilizers. Weeding may be done thrice at 60,120and 150 days after planting depending
    upon weed intensity.</p>
<h2><a name="8"></a>Irrigation</h2>
<p>Depending on the soil
    types, irrigated crops require 15-20 irrigations in heavy soils and 35-40 in light soils.
    Moisture stress affects the growth and development of the plant especially during the
    rhizome bulking stage. </p>
<h2>Plant protection</h2>
<p><span><a name="9"></a><strong>Pest</strong></span><br/><span><b><a name="10"></a>Shoot borer (<i>Conogethes punctiferalis</i>)</b></span>The presence of bore hole on the pseudostems through which the frass is extruded and the withered central shoot are the symptoms of pest infestation.<br/><span><a name="11"></a><strong>Control</strong></span><br/>Spray Malathion 0.1% at monthly interval from July to October.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="12"></a>Rhizome scale (<i>Aspidiotus hartii</i>)</span><br/>They feed on the plant sap and in the field in severe cases plants wither and dry. In storage the pest infestation results in shrivelling of buds an rhizomes and may also affect the sprouting of rhizomes.<br/>
<span><a name="13"></a><strong>Control</strong></span><br/>Dip the rhizomes in quinalphos 0.1% twice prior to storage and sowing.</p>
<h2>Diseases</h2>
<p><span><a name="14"></a><b>Rhizome rot (<i>Pythium graminicolum</i>)</b></span><br/> Collar region of the pseudostems become soft and water soaked, and the plant collapses.<br/><span><a name="15"></a><strong>Control</strong></span><br/>Drench the soil with 0.3% Dithane M-45. Dip rhizomes in the same chemical solution for 30 minutes before storage and at the time of sowing.<br/><br/><span><a name="16"></a><b>Leaf blotch (<i>Taphrina maculans</i>)</b></span><br/>There are small, oval, rectangular or irregular brown spots on either side of the leaves. The leaves turn yellow.<br/><span><a name="17"></a><strong>Control</strong></span><br/>Spray 0.2% Dithane M.45.<br/><br/><span><a name="18"></a><b>Nematodes (<i>Meloidogyne sp., Radopholus similis</i>)</b></span><br/><span><a name="19"></a><strong>Control</strong></span><br/>Apply to soil aldicarb or carbofuran granules at 1kg a.i/ha.</p>
<h2><a name="20"></a>Harvesting</h2>
<p>Depending upon the variety, the crop becomes ready for harvest in seven to nine months. The land is
    ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted
    with a spade. Harvested rhizomes are cleaned of mud and other extraneous matter adhering
    to them. The average yield per hectare is 20-25 tonnes of green turmeric.</p>
