<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Finger millet, Eleusine coracana L., is also known as African millet, koracan, ragi (India). It
    is an important staple food in parts of eastern and central Africa and India. It is an
    important cereal in Karnataka. It is extensively grown in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra
    pradesh, Orissa, Bihar, Gujrat and Maharashtra and in the hilly regions of Uttar Pradesh
    and himachal Pradesh, with a total area of 2.5 million hectares and 2.2 million tonnes of
    production. <br/><br/>The height of cultivars varies from 40 cm to I m and the spike length
    ranges from 3 to 13 cm. The colour of grains may vary from white through orange-red deep
    brown and purple, to almost black. The grains are smaller than those of pearl millet, and
    the mean I 000-seed weight is about 2.6 g. </p>
<h2><a name="culti"></a><b>Cultivation</b></h2>
<p>Ragi may be grown as a hot weather crop, from May to September, using long duration varieties
    and as a cold season crop, from November and December, using early types. Ragi is
    monocropped in India under irrigation or transplantation. Rainfed it is mostly
    intercropped with cereals, castor bean, niger, groundnut and pulses. The most common
    subsidiary crops grown with ragi are fieldbean (Lablab purpureus), pigeon pea (Cajanus
    cajan), cowpea (Vigna sinensis), and niger (Guizotia abysinnica). With groundnuts, ragi is
    the subsidiary crop. Liberal manure, mainly sheep and cattle, is applied. Green manures
    such as cowpeas, sunnhemp, artificial manures and oil cakes, have been used on both
    irrigated and unirrigated crops. Ragi is chopped and weeded at intervals of 14 days or so.
    The number and frequency of irrigations varies with seasonal conditions. </p>
