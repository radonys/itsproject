<h2><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cardamom ( <i>Elettaria
    cardamomum L.)</i> popularly, known as Queen of Spices is native to the evergreen rainy
    forests of Western Ghats in South India. It is cultivated in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil
    Nadu. Cardamom is used for flavouring various preparations of food, confectionery,
    beverages and liquors.</p>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<p><span><a name="2"></a><strong>Climate</strong></span><br/>It is grown in the areas
    where the annual rainfall ranges from 1500-4000mm, with a temperature range of 10-35<sup>o</sup>
    C and an altitude of 600-1200m above Mean Sea Level. Rainfall distribution should be good
    and summer showers during February-April are essential for panicle initiation.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="3"></a><strong>Soil</strong></span><br/>Deep black loam soil
    with high humus content found in the forest region is best suited for cultivation. It also
    grows on laterite soils, clay loams and rich black soils having good drainage. Sandy soil
    is not suitable.<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2><a name="4"></a>Varieties</h2>
<p>Coorg cardamom Malabar Selection-1 (CCS-1), ICRI-1, ICRI-2, Mudigree-1, PV-1, SKP-14.</p>
<h2><a name="5"></a>Nursery</h2>
<p>Cardamom is propagated mainly through seeds and also through suckers each consisting of atleast one old and a
    young aerial shoot. Seedlings are normally raised in primary and secondary nurseries.
    Raised beds are prepared after digging the land to a depth of 30-45cm. The beds of 1m
    width and convenient length raised to a height of about 30cm are prepared. A fine layer of
    humus-rich forest soil is spread over the beds. Seed are to be collected from well ripe
    capsules. Immediately after harvesting, the husk is removed and the seeds are washed
    repeatedly in water for removing the mucilaginous coating. Seeds should be sown
    immediately after extraction. One kg of seed capsules may produce 5000 seedlings. Sowing
    may be taken up during November-January and is done in rows. Seed beds are to be dusted
    with chloropicrin or Carbon disulphide. The germination commences in about 30 days and may
    continue for a month or two. After germination, the mulch is to be removed.<br/><br/>
<strong><a name="6"></a>Manuring</strong><br/>Manuring at the rate of
    90g nitrogen (N), 60g phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and 120g potash (K<sub>2</sub>O)
    per bed of 5x1m size, in three equal split doses at an interval of 45 days is recommended
    to produce healthier seedlings. The first dose of fertilizer may be applied 30 days after
    transplanting in the secondary nursery.</p>
<h2><a name="7"></a>Land preparation</h2>
<p>Pits of 45x45x30cm size
    are dug in April-May and filled with a mixture of top soil and compost or well decomposed
    farm yard manure. In slopy land, contour terraces may be made and pits may be taken along
    the contour and a close planting (2mx1m) is advisable along the contour.</p>
<h2><a name="8"></a>Planting</h2>
<p>The planting is carried
    out during the rainy season commencing from June. Seedlings are to be planted upto the
    collar region for better growth. Cloudy days with light drizzle are ideal for planting.
    Generally in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the seedlings are transplanted in March-May at a
    spacing of 20x 20 cm and mulched immediately. Beds are to be covered with an over head
    pandal and should be watered regularly.</p>
<h2><a name="9"></a>Fertilizer</h2>
<p>A fertilizer does of
    75kg nitrogen (N), 75kg phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) and 150g potash (K<sub>2</sub>O)
    per ha is recommended under irrigated condition for high yielding plantation yielding 100
    kg/ha and above and a dose of 30:60:30 kg/ha is recommended for gardens under rainfed
    condition. Organic manures like compost or cattle manure may be given @5 kg per clump.
    Fertilizer is applied in two split doses. The first application during May will help in
    the production of suckers and development of capsules and the second application during
    late September will help the initiation of panicles and sucker. Only half the dose of
    fertilizer is to be applied during the first year and full dose is given from second year
    onwards. Application of fertilizer is done at a radius of 30cm and covered with a thin
    layer of soil.</p>
<h2><a name="10"></a>Irrigation</h2>
<p>In order to overcome the dry spell during summer, it is necessary to irrigate the crop to get maximum production as
    it helps in initiation of panicles, flowering and fruit set. They may be irrigated at an
    interval of 10-15days till the onset of monsoon.</p>
<h2>Intercultural operations</h2>
<p><span><a name="11"></a><strong>Mulching</strong></span><br/>It is an important
    cultural practice in cardamom. Fallen leaves of the shade trees are utilized for mulching.
    Sufficient mulch should be applied during November-December to reduce the ill effects of
    drought, which prevails for nearly 4-5 months during summer. Exposing the panicle over
    mulch is beneficial for pollination.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="12"></a><strong>Weeding</strong></span><br/>
    The first round of
    weeding is to be carried in May-June, the second in August-September and the third in
    December-January. Weedicides like paraquat @625ml in 500 litres of water may be sprayed in
    the interspaces between rows leaving 60cm around the plant base.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="13"></a><strong>Trashing</strong></span><br/>
    Trashing consists of removing old and drying shoots of the plant once in a year with the onset of monsoon under
    rainfed conditions and 2-3 times in high density plantations provided with irrigated
    facilities.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="14"></a><strong>Shade regulation</strong></span><br/>
    It is very sensitive to moisture stress. Shade helps to regulate soil moisture as well as temperature and provides
    congenial micro-climate for cardamom. Excess shade is also quite detrimental and shade has
    to be regulated so as to provide 50-60% filtered sunlight. In order to provide adequate
    light during monsoon, shade regulation may be taken up before the onset of monsoon.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="15"></a><strong>Earthing up</strong></span><br/>
    After the monsoon is over, a thin layer of fresh fertile soil, rich in organic matter may be earthed up at the
    base of the clump, covering up to the collar region be scraping between the rows or
    collecting soil from staggered trenches/check pits. This encourages new growth.<br/><br/>

</p>
<h2>Disease</h2>
<p><span><a name="24"></a><b>Katte diseases</b></span><br/>
Spindle shaped, slender chlorotic flecks appear on youngest leaves, later these develop into pale green
    discontinuous stripes ass leaves mature. Infected clumps are stunted, smaller in size,
    with slender tillers and shorter panicles.<br/>
<strong><a name="25"></a>Control</strong> <br/> 
 Use healthy seedling. Rogue the infected plants. <br/><br/>
<span><a name="26"></a><b>Capsule rot</b></span><br/>
 Affected capsules turn brownish black in colour, often rotting extends to tillers and rhizomes also.<br/>
<strong><a name="27"></a>Control</strong><br/>
 Do trashing, remove infected and dead plants etc. during premonsoon months, spray 1% Bordeaux mixture during
    May and repeat again in August.<br/><br/>
<span><a name="28"></a><b>Damping or rhizome rot</b></span><br/>
  Infected seedlings collapse at collar region and die in patches, entire clump dies in grown up plants.<br/>
<strong><a name="29"></a>Control</strong><br/>
  Pre treat the nursery with 1:50 formaldehyde, drench the soil after germination with 0.2% copper oxychloride.

<h2><a name="30"></a>Harvesting and processing</h2>
<p>Cardamom plants normally
    start bearing two years after planting. In most of the areas the peak period of harvest is
    during October-November. Picking is carried out at an interval of 15-25 days. Ripe
    capsules are harvested in order to get maximum green colour during curing. After harvest,
    capsules are dried either in fuel kiln or electrical drier or in the sun. It has been
    found that soaking the freshly harvested green cardamom capsules in 2% washing soda
    solution for 10 minutes prior to drying helps to retain the green colour during drying.
    When drier is used, it should be dried at 45-50<sup>o</sup> C for 14-18 hours, while for
    kiln, over night drying at 50-60<sup> o</sup> C is required. The capsules kept for drying
    are spread thinly and stirred frequently to ensure uniform drying. The dried capsules are
    rubbed with hands or coir mat or wire mesh and winnowed to remove any foreign matter. They
    are then sorted out according to size and colour, and stored in black polythene lined
    gunny bags to retain the green colour during storage. </p>
