<h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
<p>It is a tropical crop
    and can be grown throughout the year (except very hot season i.e. March-May) for leaf
    purpose, but for higher grain yield it has to be grown in specific season. A dry and cold
    weather free from frost especially during flowering and fruit setting stage favours good
    grain production. Cloudy weather during flowering and fruiting stage favours pest and
    disease incidences. Heavy rain affects the crop. As an irrigated crop, it can be
    cultivated on almost all types of soils provided sufficient organic matter is applied.
    Black cotton soils with high retentivity of moisture is best under rainfed conditions. </p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Many improved varieties of coriander are now available for cultivation in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,
    Gujarat and Rajasthan states.</p>

<h2>Land preparation</h2>
<p>For raising a rainfed crop, the land is ploughed 3 to 4 times following rains and field must be planted
    immediately to break the clods and to avoid soil moisture. For irrigated crop the land is
    ploughed twice or thrice and beds and channels are formed. </p>
<h2>Sowing</h2>
<p>In the North and Central parts of India and Andhra Pradesh, it is mostly grown as a Rabi season crop and
    hence sowing is done between middle of October and middle of November. In certain pockets
    of the above area, late kharif crop is sometimes sown in August-September. In Tamil Nadu,
    as an irrigated crop, coriander is raised in June-July and September-October. In the first
    season, the crop matures late with an extended growth phase during January-February. The
    growth and the yield rainfed conditions, it is sown during September-October, at the onset
    of Northeast monsoon and harvested during January-February.<br/><br/>A seed rate of 10 to
    15 kg per hectare is required. Seeds stored for 15 to 30 days record better and early
    germination than freshly harvested seeds. Seeds soaked in water for 12 to 24 hours before
    sowing also enhances better germination. The seeds are split into two halves by rubbing
    and generally done in rows spaced at 30 to 40 cm apart with 15 cm between hills. Soil
    depth should not exceed 3.0 cm. Three to five seeds are sown in seeds are broadcast and
    covered with country plough. Germination takes place in 10 to 15 days. </p>
<h2>Manures and fertilisers</h2>
<p>About 10 tonnes of farmyard manure is applied at the time of last preparation. In addition, the following
    fertilizers may be applied.</p>

<h2>Irrigation</h2>
<p>First irrigation is given 3 days after sowing and thereafter at 10 to 15 days interval depending upon the soil
    moisture available in the soil. </p>
<h2>Interculturing</h2>
<p>The first hoeing and weeding and weeding are given in about 30 days. Thinning the plants is also attended
    simultaneously, leaving only two plants per hill. Depending upon the growth one or two
    more weeding are done.</p>
<h2>Harvesting and yield</h2>
<p>The crop will be ready for harvest in about 90 to 110 days depending upon the varieties and growing season.
    Harvesting has to be done when the fruits are fully ripe and start changing from green to
    brown colour. Delaying of the harvest should be avoided lest shattering during harvest and
    splitting of the fruits in subsequent processing operations. The plants are cut or pulled
    and poled into small stacks in the field to beating with sticks or rubbing with hands. The
    produce is winnowed, cleaned and dried in partial shade. After drying, the produce is
    stored in gunny bags lined with paper. The rainfed crop yields on an average 400 to 500
    kg/ha and the irrigated crop 600 to 1200kg/ha.</p>
