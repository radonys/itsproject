<h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
<p>It is a hardy tropical
    plant and does not exact a very specific, climate. It can come up in places situated
    within 35 latitude on either side of the equator and also in the hill ranges upto 700 m
    MSL. It can grow well in places receiving rainfall from 50 cm to 250 cm and tolerate a
    temperature range of 25 to 49 C. it requires a bright weather and does not tolerate
    excessive shade.<br/><br/>
    Cashew is cultivated on a wide variety of soils in India like laterite, red and coastal sandy soil. To a
    limited extent, it is also grown on black soils. It can be also grown in hill slopes in
    virgin organic matter rich soils. They do not prefer water logged or saline soils. </p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Since cashew is a highly
    cross-pollinated crop, planting of seedlings is not recommended now. Various cashew
    research centres have released improved clones, which are either selections from seedling
    population or hybrids. They are briefly described in the following table:</p>

<h2>Propagation</h2>
<p><b>Seed Propagation</b><br/>Seed propagation is
    seldom practised now except to raise the rootstock materials. Seeds should be collected
    during the month of March to May and the heavy seed nuts, which sink in water, are alone
    mixed with 2 parts of fine sand. They take normally 15 to 20 days for germination.<br/><br/>
<b>Vegetative propagation</b><br/>
    One year old shoots as
    well as current season shoots are used for air-layering. Though there is good root
    development in this method, heavy mortality occurs both at nursery stage and on the main
    field. Other drawbacks of this method are that it is cumbersome, time consuming and
    production of a limited number of layers per tree and as such layers are also not suitable
    for cyclone prone areas as they do not have a tap root providing less anchorage to soil.<br/><br/>
    The vegetative
    propagation through cuttings is seldom practised, as success is very less. Similarly
    veneer grafting, side grafting and patch budding are also reported to be successful but
    the nursery period is quite long, 3 to 4 years. Recently 'epicotyl grafting' and 'soft
    wood grafting' are recommended for commercial scale adoption. In the case of epicotyl
    grafting, tender seedlings with height of 15 cm are selected as root stocks and a 'V'
    shaped cut is made after beheading it at a height of 4 to6 cm from the cotyledons
    connective. The precured scion is collected and a wedge is made at the base of it, so as
    to exactly fit in the cut made in the stock. The scion is exactly fitted in the stock and
    tied with polythene strips. The success of epicotyl grafting varies from 50 to 60 per cent
    and depends upon high humidity, temperature, freedom from fungal disease, number of rainy
    days and rate of cambial growth. When the above method is adopted in 30 to 40 days old
    seedling, it is known as soft wood grafting. The success varies from 40 to 50 per cent.
</p>
<h2>Planting</h2>
<p>Pits of 45x45x45 cm
    are dug and filled with a mixture of top soil, 10 kg of farm yard manure and one kg of
    neem cake at a distance of 7m x7m either way during June July and planted. In the case of
    seedling, 45 days old seedlings are transplanted.</p>
<h2>Training and pruning</h2>
<p>All the side shoots
    must be removed upto a height of atleast 2m from the ground to cause the branches to form
    and spread out from the upper section of the trunk. Periodical pruning of dead wood and
    criss cross branches during the month of July is recommended to minimise the losses
    through diseases such as dieback and to increase the yield.</p>

<h2>Top working</h2>
<p>As most of the existing cashew plantations are of seedling progenies, the yield level is very low and highly erratic. Hence, top working with improved clones are suggested now. Trees of 20 to 25 years old are beheaded at a height of 0.5 m from the ground during December-February. A paste, made using 50 g, each of BHC 50 per cent wettable powder and copper oxychloride in a litre of water, should be applied all over the stump to check any infection by invading pathogens and borer insects. Profuse sprouting normally results in but only 10 to 15 healthy shoots and properly spaced on the stumps are alone retained. These shoots are grafted at softwood stage (cleft grafting) when they are about 40 to 50 days old. 7-8 successful grafts may be encouraged to grown and the sprouts should be periodically removed. Top worked trees grown vigorously due to the well established root system and they start yielding about 4kg per tree from the second year of rejuvenation and the yield gradually increases to stabilise at 8 kg from the fourth year of top working.</p>
<h2>Yield</h2>
<p>The yield depends upon many factors. Individual trees, which yield more than 6 kg after 15 years, are considered as good yielders.</p>
<h2>Cashew processing</h2>
<p>Processing consists of roasting, shelling, extracting the oil, peeling, grading and packing<br/><br/>
<b>Roasting</b><br/>
Roasting makes the shells brittle, besides making the extraction of kernels easier. A slight underoasting or overroasting adversely affects the quality and recovery of kernels. In the open pan roasting method, one kilogram of nuts are kept in shallow iron pans or earthen pots and are heated over an open fire. The nuts are rapidly turned to prevent charring. The roasted nuts are then removed from the pan and thrown on the floor. They are quickly covered with earth, which would absorb shell oil adhering to the roasting nuts and also cool them. The nuts are then subjected to subsequent operations. The cashew nuts are also roasted by drying under sun for two to three days when they lose much of the moisture contents and become brittle enough for shelling. The other improved methods of roasting cashewnuts are<br/><br/>
<strong>i. Continuous roasting process</strong><br/>
The principle adopted in this system is the same as in the case of open pan roasting method. This plant consists of a single walled or double walled rotating metallic drum. In the case of double walled drum, the smoke or gases produced during roasting escape through the interspace between the two walls of the drum and are condensed to shell oil by a cooling system but in the case of single walled drum, the gases that escape from the nuts during the process of roasting are allowed to escape through a chimney provided at the lower end and there is no provision for collecting shell liquid.<br/><br/>
<strong>ii. Oil bath process</strong><br/>
In this method, the nuts are held in wire trays and are passed through a bath of cashew shell oil maintained at a temperature of 200 to 2020C for a period of three minutes whereby the shell oil is recovered from the shells to the maximum possible extent. This process ensures uniform roasting of nuts and eliminates charring of kernels.<br/><br/>
<b>Shelling</b><br/>
After roasting, shelling is done by labour. Each nut is placed edgewise and cracked open with a light wooden mallet and the kernel extracted with or without the help of a wire prong. Care has to be taken that the inner kernel is intact and is not broken into bits.<br/><br/>
<b>Peeling</b><br/>
Removal of a thin outer brown skin is done by hand with the help of a safety pin or small hand knife. Peeling is made easier when the kernels are subjected to a heat treatment for about four hours in a drying chamber. After peeling, the kernels are spread out indoors on cement flooring so that they may absorb some moisture and become less brittle. This prevents the tendency to break easily during grading.<br/><br/>
<b>Grading</b><br/>
Grading is done based on "counts" or number of kernels per pound. The kernels, which have no split, are separated as 'wholes'. These are again separated into six grades as 210,240,280,320,400 and 430 whole nuts per pound. The graded kernels should be fully developed, ivory white in colour and free from insect damage and black or brown spots. The broken and split kernels are then separated and classified as standard and scorched pieces, splits, butts, small pieces and each grade is separately packed.<br/><br/>
<b>Packing</b><br/>
Packing is done in this. In this method, the air inside the tine is exhausted and they are recharged with Co2 before they are sealed air-tight.</p>
