<h2>Climate and Soil</h2>
<p>It has a wide adaptability and is successfully cultivated both in the tropics as well as temperate
    regions. It is tolerant to frost and freezing weather. It does well in places receiving
    moderate or low rainfall areas but not in heavy rainfall area. It can be grown on a wide
    variety of soils but clayey loam is relatively better. The optimum soil pH should be 6.0
    to 7.0 for its better growth and development. </p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Many improved cultivars are now available for cultivation. They are briefly described hereunder.</p>

<h2>Land preparation and sowing</h2>
<p>Land is prepared by ploughing thrice and beds of uniform size are prepared. Broadcasting the seed in the bed
    and raking the surface to cover the seeds is normally followed. But, line sowing is
    advocated in rows at 20 to 25 cm apart which facilitates the intercultural operations. <br/><br/>Sowing in the plains
    is generally taken up in September to November while in the hills, it is grown from March.
    Approximately 20 to 25 kg of seed is required for one hectare and the seed takes about 6-8
    days to complete its germination.</p>
<h2>Manures and fertilizers</h2>
<p>Besides 15 tonnes of farm yard manure, a fertilizer dose of 25 kg Nitrogen, 25 kg Phosphorus and 50 kg Potash
    per ha is recommended. Half of the nitrogen dose and the entire quantity of phosphorus and
    potash are applied basally and the remaining half Nitrogen is applied 30 days after
    sowing. To obtain more successful leafy growth, nitrogen should be applied after each
    cutting.</p>
<h2>Irrigation</h2>
<p>First irrigation is given immediately after sowing and subsequent irrigation is applied at 7 to 10 days interval.</p>
<h2>Harvesting</h2>
<p>In about 25 to 30 days, young shoots are nipped off 4 to 5 cm above ground level and subsequent cuttings of
    leaves may be taken after 15 days. It is advisable to take 1 to 2 cuttings before the crop
    is allowed for flowering and fruiting. When pods are dried, the plants are pulled out,
    dried in the sun and seeds are threshed by beating with stick or by rubbing with hands.
    Seeds are winnowed, cleaned and dried in the sun. They may be stored in gunny bags lined
    with paper.</p>
<h2>Yield</h2>
<p>A yield of 1200 to 1500 kg of seeds and about 800 to 100 kg of leaves may be obtained per hectare in crops grown for both the purposes.</p>
