
<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Bajra popularly known as Pearl millet, cattail millet or bulrush belongs to the family Graminea.
    The crop is cultivated for grain as well as for fodder in the arid region of Africa and
    Asia and as a pasture in U.S.A. It is originated in India or Africa. It is grown all over
    India except Assam and part of northeast India.</p>
<h2><a name="cli"></a>Climate and soil:</h2>
<p>The crop has a wide adaptability as it may grow under different day lengths, temperature and
    moisture stress. Most of the varieties developed in India are photosensitive which helps
    in growing the crop during monsoon, rabi and arid season. It requires low annual rainfall
    ranging between 40-50 cm and dry weather. The crop may tolerate drought but cannot
    withstand high rainfall of 90 cm or above. Light soils of low inherent fertility good
    drainage, mild salinity are best type for this crop. Crop does not tolerate soil acidity</p>
<h2><a name="land"></a>Land preparation:</h2>
<p>The crop needs very fine tilt because the seeds are too small. 2-3 harrowings and a ploughing
    is followed so that a fine tilth may be obtained to facilitate the sowing and proper
    distribution of seed at appropriate depth. </p>
<h2><a name="varie"></a>Varieties: </h2>
<p>NBH-149, VBH-4 developed for Andhra Pradesh,
    Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra are capable of producing 14% higher yield.<br/>
    ICM4-155 gave higher yield than the standard check and adopted for all growing tracts of
    India.Also H-306, NH-338 and hybrid like MP-204, MP205 have been identified.</p>
<h2><a name="sow"></a>Sowing</h2>
<p>Sowing time :- Most appropriate time
    of sowing is middle or last week of July<br/>
    Seed rate and Spacing:- <br/>
    4-5 kg/ha for drilling method<br/>
    2.5-3 kg/ha for dibbling method<br/>
    spacing 40 45 cm between rows, 10 15 cm within rows.<br/>
    Seed treatment- The organo-mercurial compound Ceresan, Agrosan should be used @ 2.5-3
    kg/ha to control seed borne diseases</p>
<p>Generally the crop requires low quantity of nutrients. But All India Co-ordinated Millet
    Improvement Project has proved that new plant types of bajra especially hybrids respond to
    very high doses of fertilizers.<br/><br/>Under rainfed areas
    application of organic manures such as FYM or compost helps in increasing the crop yield
    at the rate of 150-200 quintals/ha 80 100 kg N:40-50 kgP:40-50kgK is recommended
    dose for hybrid variety. <br/><br/>Fertilizers are
    applied in split doses, half of nitrogen, full phosphorus and potash should be basal
    placed at the time of sowing . The organic manures must be applied 20 days before the
    sowing of the seeds for full decomposition. One fourth dose of nitrogen should be applied
    about 30 days and 60 days after sowing.</p>
<h2><a name="iner"></a>Interculture</h2>
<p>Thinning or gap filling is followed at the time of first interculture. Hand weeding is followed to
    control the weeds or application of Atrazine @ 0.5 kg/ha would take care of most of the
    weeds.</p>
<h2><a name="irri"></a>Irrigation:</h2>
<p>Bajra is grown rainfed and crop being drought resistant hardly needs any irrigation, however it
    is observed that the yield may be significantly increased by irrigating the crop at
    critical growth stages like maximum tillering, flowering and grain filling stage.
    Therefore light irrigations and efficient drainage is very essential for bajra production.</p>
<h2><a name="plant"></a>Plant protection measures</h2>
<p><strong>a) Insect pests:</strong><br/> Stem bores and
    grasshoppers are serious pests of bajra controlled by two sprayings with 2 litres of
    Eldrin 20 c.c and grasshoppers may be controlled by dusting the crop with BHC 5 percent.<br/><br/>
<strong>b) Diseases: </strong><br/>
    Downy mildew- for controlling this disease
    seed treatment with fungicide like Dithane Z-78 or M-45 @ 2.0kg/ha in 800-1000 lit. of
    water.<br/>
    Smut- Treatment with Ceresan or Thirum @ 1-2 g/kg seeds is effective.<br/>
    Ergot- Seed treatment with 20% common salt solution followed by washing with fresh water
    and then treating with Ceresan or Thirum @ 1-2 g/kg seeds is effective</p>
