<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction:</h2>
<p>The genus Ocimum (tulsi) belongs to the family Labiateae. Many species of Ocimum contain
    various economically important essential oils used in perfumery and cosmetics industries.
    The major constituents in Ocimum oils include linalool, geraniol, citral, camphor,
    eugenol, methyl chavicol, safrol, thymol, methylcinnamate etc. Ocimum species are used as
    herbs and find diverse uses in the indigenous systems of medicine in countries like India,
    Africa, Arabia, Australia, Malaya, pacific islands and Sri Lanka. The oil of certain
    species of Ocimum has the antifungal, bactericidal and insecticidal properties too.</p>
<h2><a name="uses"></a>Verieties</h2>
<p>The Regional Research Laboratory, Jammu has done extensive crop improvement programme in ocimum and evolved newer promising types,
    which are now recommended for commercial cultivation. The varieties are:<br/>
    O. canum RRL-01, <br/>
    O. americanum RRL-02<br/>
    O. viride RRL-08<br/>
    O. gratissimum RRL-08<br/>
    O. basilicum RRL-07<br/>
    O. basilicum RRL-011<br/>
    Synthesized Amphidiploid of Ocimum RRL-015<br/>
    O. gratissimum</p>
<h2><a name="cli"></a>Climate and Soil:</h2>
<p>It is a tropical to subtropical plant, it
    prefers fairly to high rainfall areas with high humid conditions. Long day and high
    temperature condition enhance growth and higher oil production.Ocimum can be grown in
    rich loam to poor lateritic soils. It can also come up in saline or alkaline soils to
    moderately acidic soils. Proper drainage is however essential as waterlogging condition
    results in poor growth.</p>
<h2><a name="land"></a>Field Preparation:</h2>
<p>The land is well prepared with two or three
    ploughings until a fine a fine tilth of soil is obtained. Farmyard manure may be applied
    before the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> ploughing. The crop is raised from seeds and
    can be grown annually from the middle of February to the end of September by direct sowing
    or transplanting.Manures Â– Generally, no manure is required, but an application of
    20-25 Kg of NOTES and 10-15 Kg of P per hectare after one month from planting give good
    herbage and oil yield. Micronutrients given as foliar spraying especially 50 ppm of Cu and
    100 ppm of Mo increase the total oil content in O. sanctum</p>
<h2><a name="harvesting"></a>Harvesting</h2>
<p>From sowing to first harvesting, it takes about 90-100 days in the case of direct sown and 75-90 days in the transplanted crop. The
    plants are cut 20-25 cm above the ground level in the first year, 20-30cm level in second
    year and 35-45 cm level in the third year.</p>
